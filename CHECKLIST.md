# ‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## What to Do Right Now:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open PowerShell in Project Folder

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\pc\Documents\My Projects\pos_system_api"
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Publish Command

**OPTION A - Recommended (Self-Contained)**:

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o ./publish
```

_This creates ~80-120 MB of files_

**OPTION B - If hosting has .NET 6.0**:
First, edit `pos_system_api.csproj` and change `net8.0` to `net6.0`, then:

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
```

_This creates ~5-10 MB of files_

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Files

Open the `publish` folder and check:

- [ ] `pos_system_api.exe` exists (for Option A)
- [ ] `pos_system_api.dll` exists (for Option B)
- [ ] `web.config` exists
- [ ] `appsettings.json` exists
- [ ] Many `.dll` files present

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload to MonsterASP.NET

1. Login to MonsterASP.NET control panel
2. Open File Manager or FTP client
3. Navigate to your web root folder (wwwroot / httpdocs / public_html)
4. **DELETE** old files first
5. Upload **ALL** files from the `publish` folder
6. Wait for upload to complete

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test Your Website

Visit these URLs:

- [ ] http://pos-pharamcy-system.runasp.net/ ‚Üí Should show welcome message
- [ ] http://pos-pharamcy-system.runasp.net/drugs ‚Üí Should show drug list
- [ ] http://pos-pharamcy-system.runasp.net/swagger ‚Üí Should show API docs
